A Minecraft launcher that I made long time ago

## Features

* Launching Minecraft
* Reading Minecraft's console output
* Downloading Minecraft.jar and dependencies
* Fetching assets from Mojang servers with my own ~~shitty~~ multi-thread implementation
* Being translated to multiple languages
* Updating itself
* Downloading modpacks from a specific server

It also has integrated JavaScript support.

## Dependencies
Dependencies required to compile:
* Newtonsoft.Json
* a modified version of MaterialSkin
